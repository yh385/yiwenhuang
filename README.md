Hi! My name is Yiwen Huang and I am from Flushing, New York City!

I am currently a sophomore majoring in computer science at Cornell University.

This is just a repository of some of the cool projects I have worked on during
my time here. Some are for classes I am taking, others are just during freetime.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at yh385@cornell.edu.
